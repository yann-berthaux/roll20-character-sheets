# Maximum Apocalypse

Building the sheet from scratch, while learning Roll20 custom sheet conventions & CCS grids along the way.

Haven't actually played a game of Maximum Apocalypse yet, but it looks like a really fun setting with interesting character, roll & inventory mechanics.

I'm using this project as a way to become familiar with the mechanics.

## Usage Notes

- Structure very close to to core rulebook
- Automatically calculates all derived stats: half/quarter stats, special stats, build/repair table & encumbrance
- Roll buttons for stats, skills & special stats
- Roll buttons query for 0-3 advantages/disadvantages & implement advantage/disadvantage effects
- Roll template indicates level & degree of success
- Tick the "Threshold modifier prompt on every roll" checkbox to specify misc. threshold modifer for subsequent rolls
- Drop down selections for archetypes, apocalypse & skill proficiencies
- Initiative includes modifiers from being encumbered, shaken, acute, starving & emaciated
- Temporary initiative modifier field for situational special ability effects 
- Faith & Reflex ability benefits automatically calculated
- Special Ability and Gear descriptions can be expanded/contracted to see the full text when needed
- Hunger conditions will highlight in red when active
- Starving condition will apply -10 modifier to base stats (modifier indicator will appear next to base stats)
- Structure deviations from core rulebook implemented to provide enough room for Special Ability and Gear descriptions

## Planned enhancements

- Fix weapon DC field to accept letters
- Change weapon trait field font to match abilities & gear (more room for text)
- Add buttons for defense & build/repair rolls
- Add button for weapon attack and damage rolls
- Default proficiency roll prompt to disadvantage for non-proficient skills
- Implement Disadvantage to all rolls when Emaciated
- Implement special ability conditional modifier roll queries
